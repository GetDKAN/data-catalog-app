  "description": "Groups allow you to classify datasets that share a common publisher or organizational group (i.e. Parks and Recreation Department, Department of Education). Behind the scenes, Groups can offer an additional set of roles and permissions that ensure quality and security when publishing data. This is especially important for large sites that may have several working groups publishing data to the same site."
